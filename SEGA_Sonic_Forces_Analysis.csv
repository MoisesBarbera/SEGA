5,"The game is very fun and addictive. It's fun to play when there is nothing to do or to just kill time. I do have one problem with the game though. After a certain amount of games played, you will stop earning your daily chest after a game and since I do play the game a lot, I run out of chests pretty quick and when I'm not getting any rewards for playing, I feel like I'm playing for nothing. Even the 4 chests spots fill up fast so I rarely get anything for playing"
5,"fun to play. however, there should be like we are able to play with friends in facebook or something. link our friends together somehow. instead of playing against random people or computer only."
5,"Having a fun time playing the game. All the different characters give me a nostalgia feeling from back in the day. Haven't come across any bugs and the in-app purchases are reasonably priced. Wish there was a way to race against friends, but other than that Sonic Forces is awesome!"
5,Really good it might be a bit glitchy at first but it gets better amazing game
5,I like the song and the graphics. I love EVERY thing in the game
5,"Great game but tons of glitches. I had all characters unloced except for the female z. I also had baby sonic and slugger sonic, now all of my progress was erased, thus making the YEAR i spent on this game put to waste. Im disappointed in this game. Edit: I found that if you uninstall. the game then reinstall it, you sould get a message saying they are getting your account information back and giving you the. account back."
5,"This Game is so Amazing! Hello Sega, This is Max Here and Right now I am Rating Sonic Forces. I Like this Game Because You Get To play as all Of the Sonic Characters in the game, and you can Race other players, And Also I Like The new Sonic movie Update, Nice Job. 😉 And You also Have Quests To do and once you complete Them...YOU GET CHESTS! You know what they say. GOTTA GO FAST! And I'm Gonna go FAST Right outta here. Bye!"
5,I love Sonic Forces I just downloaded the game a few weeks ago and it's Epic and I hope this is not to much to ask for but can you please add Dr.Robotnik/Dr.Eggman as a playable character and can you guys please add a game mode where you can battle other characters against each other that would be c...
5,This game is way better than I thought. It is like sonic dash but with better graphics more characters! And more microtransactions... that's not a good thing I guess. But there are always good deals to! Say there could be a 9.99$ for only 2.99 one day! It is cool and is a good time waster!
5,"It is a fun game and while I don't think it has as much potential as Sonic Dash, which is in desperate need of new characters and alternate looks for characters, something this game should also consider. Never the less, it is still a fun game and worth a download. I personally play both this and the first Dash game a lot."
5,It is the best sonic game. i found out big the cat is a good guy.The game has all the charecter and even costumes.
5,i really like the game but dont make us use 100 red star rings to change our name please.Keep going and never stop updating the game.Your doing an incredible job!!!!!!!!
5,"It's a good game, but some of the characters are ridiculously hard to unlock."
5,"Fantastic! It's really great game I can't say anything bad about it, bcs it's perfect"
5,Very Interactive Its fun and you play with other people Like the first and second but BETTER!
5,"This game is skill ranked. It still is really fun though. If you are an adult and used to play the old Sonic The Hedgehog games, you MIGHT like it. If you're a kid who really enjoys Sonic, you will definitely love it. It even comes with easy challenges to unlock different characters."
5,This game is really exciting and fun to play. It's like a sonic race mixed with Mario kart. That's probably the best analogy to describe it. There's a lot of rewards and events going on to keep you interested. I like this game a lot.
5,"Competitive races against 3 other players. Matches only last about a minute or so, and you're usually matched with players with similar skills. Prizes are awarded based off of performance and participation with a daily limit. Some of these prizes are time locked. Unlock many Sonic characters and cos..."
5,Very nice app. I am one who is fan for sonic. Characters and multiplayer are perfect 👌
5,AMAZING GAME! I don't know why Sonic Forces is so underrated... I LOVE IT!!! It's one of the best Sonic games ever! Same with speed battle! It's great! Please continue to make great Sonic games like this! Also can you please make Sonic 3 and Knuckles for mobile? Add it to Sega forever pleeeeaaaaase!!! 👍
5,I have a problem with the favorite thing. For some reason it just randomly chooses which favorite if it wasn't my favorite. Like say Amy. Amy instantly got on my favorite list even though she is not my favorite. So I would like it if there was an option to choose the favorite. Maybe add a star or heart or Sonic logo and press it it would add to the favorite list. I would appreciate it. So I still give a 5 but please remove the random fav please. So 5 🌟cuz I love the game.. 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟= rad!!
5,A good time. Surprised at how deep the game can be with only directional controls
5,It's fun 😊👍grueiei you have any questions or later in a buffalo chicken if you don't want you to get in a buffalo wings and the sho I will start working out again 😉 but I don't want to go to get a hold it turns out the demo actually is really good for me and my family 😊❤️ you happy birthday to you and many other people get to see you tomorrow night then I will start working with you in you 😘😘😉 but you can play with me and loving me with the information that was today but you can play with
5,"It's REALLY fun. And when I say fun, I mean fun. But it takes a lot of time to get characters. And in Sonic forces on my PS4 you don't fight Chaos. There's Chaos in this game. But good luck if you get good characters. Still five stars."
5,"Its a great game but it would be cool if we could make our own sonic characters like in sonic forces for switch. And the movie sonic update was AMAZING but what about knuckles and tails they were in it but why not an event for them. And it would be nice to have like Sonic boom in the game because you already have Teen sonic, Modern Sonic,and classic sonic iean you might as well just add sonic boom. OTHER RHAN THAT THIS GAME....EPIC!!!"
5,"A really fun game although I wish that you could change your name without paying 100 FREAKING RED STAR RINGS!!!SEGA, DO YOU KNOW HOW HARD IT IS TO GET 25 RED STAR RINGS?!? I do like the Special characters except I think that they're too rare because it's normally a one-time event so I think that after you get all the Common, Rare, and Super Rares, you should get the Special guys next."
5,this game is so awesome I can't stop playing that I don't play me for the rest of my life and I give it five stars because I have 15 favorite charmy Amy Sonic tails knuckles big rouge teen Sonic baby Sonic elf classic Sonic Santa big vampire shadow reaper metal Sonic wave All-Star amy
5,"I love this gameplay, beautiful art and characters. Good job Sega. It's a bit too many ads btw."
5,This game is great. It is fun to race online and there are many characters to choose from. It is fun to play and I love it.
5,I had alot of fun playing this game it is one of those games that make me play games on mobile and not on my PlayStation first of all it's kinda strategic with different stats and powerups I can spend an hour thinking of the perfect character for me and I won't get bored it's really addicting once you start playing you can't stop the game doesn't get old it has too much replayability with season trophy reset events overall great game you really should really give it a try best endless runnergame
5,"Very very good game but please I would like Sega to add eggman,dr robotnik from sonic move,donut lord aka Tom wachowski,super sonic,gerald robotnik,E-102 Gamma,orbot,cubot,super shadow,Eggrobo,burnbot, and Tom's wachowski s power will be tranquilizing other players for 15 seconds and putting people in cages for 5 seconds and his last power is throwing two small donuts that are attached together with chains and they hit the players legs and ties around them for 15 secs and then they fall."
5,Super fun. This reminds me of the Sonic games I've played on the PSP & PS2.
5,"Absolutely love the app Firstly, the graphics are fantastic with the realistic and Original Sonic Colour scheme. Secondly, the selection of characters you can pick from when you fist start the game and the selection when you progress through the gameand collect cards for new heroes. Lastly, the Power ups you can use in the games to stop the players ahead of you from winning and slow them down. This is a great game, please give it a 5 star rate and keep playing. 😀👍"
5,"If you haven't installed this game yet then you DEFINITELY should cuz it's really fun, entertaining and shows you more about sonic and his friends.You can race, you can unlock new cool characters, discover more powers and come across different adventures so if I were you I'd install this game and go to the world of FUN!"
5,"The racing game is like sonic dash 3,if you know what I mean *wink*.And also why is there no story mode.I don't care what those 2 below said about this game,what matters is that it is a very good game and that's that. Oh, one thing you need to have like a good internet connection to play."
5,"This game is legit probably the best mobile game out right now. Events are common and fun to take part in, gameplay is fluent and graphics are decent even on low settings! Only problem is how the chests work. You can only open one at a time and to open one immediately, it costs a lot of red rings. It takes forever to open a chest if it's not a 3 hour one, and I wish that you could open multiple chests at once so you don't spend your days waiting for chests to unlock. Highly recommend it though!"
5,"It's a great game that is designed just like sonic dash and sonic racing put into one. If I had one complaint it would be that sometimes the internet is slow and you can run into an obstacle without even being able to control yourself. Otherwise, it's a great game, and I totally recommend it."
5,I love this game this game is so cool so happy I found it and if there was $100 I will give you 100 but they're not song and I really do like them in this
5,I love this game it so creative and Sonic is very creative too I love this game and I never had problems so it's good.
5,"This game is really good and is great to kill some time with. The ads are annoying, but they are easy to get rid of"
5,I love this game but the only issue is that take forever to get more characters make it easier easier
5,Fun and competitive kinda repetitive but in a good way there is a ladder that you can climb and it makes it fun... A bunch of heros with different skills and stats there are ad o lyrics if you want to 2x your rewards over all g8 game just dont stop updating with events even new maps Thank you.
5,"This game is great, because it lets me play it, although, every time I go offline the game to play another, later when I go back on the game it says ""Not connected to the battle"" and it has a button that says ""RETRY"". Anyway, the game is great."
5,this game is awesome I like the concept of sonic racing but I really wish they didn't put forces in the title also you have to give silver better stats and abilliteis or i will uninstall the game
5,"I really enjoy playing this game, it is a lot of fun while remaining competitive. Plenty of events and characters are well balanced."
5,"Typical P2W. Sort of like Mario Kart, but a Runner. A lot of unlocks and upgrades. Not bad, expect to pay. Complaints are warranted, but it's still good for what it is."
5,"This game reminds me of the actual Sonic Forces. Its so awesome, the grafics are very surprising, if you are a sonic fan, i recommend this game"
5,"Probably the most generous freemium game on the store. Common characters are toe-to-toe with super rare characters and the last ones are guaranteed with enough playtime, differing from most gacha systems. Gameplay is fun, fast-paced and challenging"
5,I like this game it's amazing in the whole wide world and I I'm DS. It's always in the down-low d station. Every time I play I never give but sometimes I get and I got it from the game store when a car for me game store I actually didn't get it from the game store but I agate happy sometimes because sometimes I get happy because I win. When I'm at the last level I get a side dish.
5,The game is soo leggy and the powers don't work like for example I was so close to the finish line and the game would kick me out I was really angry that time so Sega please fix the game pleasessss!! I hate this game Sega please!!!!!
5,"Great time pass, the micro transactions are even and not too much not to little. And great gameplay"
5,"I have made great progress in this game without paying anything, and that sense of progression in a game about a series I enjoy is very good. That's pretty much the only reason I like it other than the gameplay being great, and sometimes there doesn't need to be loads of reasons I like something. Since this game is free, I recommend downloading it."
5,"I love the movie 😍 and I love the game,can you put multiplayer like a room to invite friends to play with them online."
5,"I love this game BUT my only problem is the trophy system at the end of a track! I get so annoyed when I com first and then the guy in 3rd place gets more trophies than me, it just doesn't make any sense! I would really appreciate it if you guys could fix that but other than that this game is great!"
5,"Well,a fun game and it is kinda similar to Mario Kart but u level up your character and different character= Different items. This is why i really like this game"
5,"It's so amazing also add infinite as a playable character and if you play with/against infinite it plays infinites theme. Have original the character as a playable character and ,make original the character customizable you could also spend rings for clothing and unlock clothing. Original the character can be a starting character then it would be perfect."
5,this is a good game but it does have some Minor Details the fix but all in all it's a good game and I highly recommend it for any fan but it is a running game So the graphics ain't going to be that good but still it's pretty good
5,Great game. Super addictive first race that i did i was addicted and playex for another hour. Only problem is is that it is a payed to win kinda game but it is still a great game
5,This game is awsome I love how the characters are created and one thing when I race and I try to move it won't let me I like can move two times Sega can you please fix that but I give 5 stars.
5,"This is an awsome game. The graphics the details is is just amazing. Really wish you guys could bring back the old main menu music ""This is our World"", I think that's what the song is called. Other than that really awsome game keep up the good work and the good events and updates. Greetings to the team who made this amazing game"
5,Super cool. I like all the updates that aren't keep happening like egg man assault Every Hero has a genius. Race into theaters Pretty though. Stage 1 and 2 You can res you can unlock characters. Like Vector jet Sonic Tails
5," love this app. It can be a little bit laggy, sure, but it's the app I go to whenever I am bored and check out what I've missed. Check it out!"
5, love this game because you have to look quick and try not to hit any thing and that what I like SPEED baby.... wait what no way NO WAY SONIC THE MOVIE character is here wow....... and baby sonic the movie THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER 5 stars ✨
5,"Amazing! Play this game and you will really like It. Watch as Sonic Tails Knuckles Amy Baby sonic Teen sonic shadow and more, race side by side and try to get 1st. Sonic lovers will enjoy this!"
5,"It's totally awesome! Though, just one suggestion, it would be great if there were side missions, to race all the bad guys from the original sega game, for various prizes. You know, like easy races for gold rings, medium for red rings, and hard for character fragments. It is also a great way to sharpen your thought process and better your hand-eye skills. So thanks and BRAVO for the game guys!"
5,This game is so easy to play. i like character sonic . It has easy missons . And easy to unlock characters. Please download the game and enjoy and rate this for five stars
5,"This game is ( for me the best Sonic game on mobile) very well thought of when it was made. But there is one problem, you have to pay actual money for this one vault called Tails Vault where you have to pay for the Special cards which include Teen Sonic and Baby Soni from the 2020 movie. Other than that... great game Sega!"
5,This game is one of my favorite games because you can get all your favorite characters and play as them and when you load into the game they give you daily prizes and i think that is Soooo amazing i play this everyday its addicting my favorite character is them all they are all the best😘💙 the best part is RACING when you go into a race you can meet real people and see who wins if you win you get trophies but in 1st you get the most im begging please download this app most appreciated by:JJ
5,"Always loved Sega games since the Sega master system days. Thanks for bringing back the memories! My only issue is that the game can be a drain on your battery so keep your phone charged. Anyhow, this is a wonderful mobile game that can play on some lower end phones too, great visuals, complete with the classic Sonic music and sound effects. A great tie-in to the Sonic movie in theaters now!"
5,"Perfect choice if ur looking for a good racing game! Not mant ads, a lot of characters, and a ton of events and prizes! 5 stars!"
5,"Really Fun game! I simply love it. It's a Shame we cannot play as Infinite, though but it's amazing!"
5,"It's a fun a game to play. You can play as your favorite characters and versions of Modern Sonic, Baby Sonic (2020 film), Teen Sonic (2020 film) and Classic Sonic. Plus other"
5,This game is so fun and i love sonic the hedgehog and plus i seen the movie and me and my best friend love sonic and we will never stop loving it forever on going until we get older and we love the game so much that i do not care to stop loving it because my best friend has all of sonic collections
5,Wicked awesome mad excellent game. Awesome music. Awesome characters. A definite fun way to pass time when bored. I just wish that ugly boring TikTok wouldn't show up at all. Keep up the good work Sega and developers behind this game
5,"To me, this game is like a demo version of the actual game! I like that they added more and more characters! Also, this game is basically the next level of Sonic Dash, but even better! Thank you, Sega!"
4,"This game is great! The cons, there is times when the game stops working when you are in the middle of the race, or when you can't get any powers because the signal is not working, spatially when you are playing against players with higher level."
4,"The gameplay is fun if a little confusing with a couple power ups - some characters are straight up just better than others and there is no offline or unranked mode, besides that the game is intricate and interesting, allowing you to unlock and play all your favourite characters without spending a penny."
4,"I love this game i also love it bc this game is it's own unique game i also love how u added each character to have a different ability and the rarity for each character.This game is amazing,but i wish that there was a login bc my phone broke and i had every character in the game and i can't get that acc back so this time I want a login so if my phone breaks i can login into the account.otherwise i love this game (◡ ω ◡)"
4,"It is a really great game Its just that its kinda repetitive Take for example Sonic Dash... You have to rebuild the ""hub environments"" to unlock a new place Sonic Forces: Speed Battle needs something like that in my opinion"
4,"It's alright, but matches take way too long to begin, and you have way too many rings. Seriously, I've upgraded all the characters I have to level 4 or higher, and still have over 20k rings. Maybe make some chests purchasable with rings?"
4,Definitely a fun game. Something nice to pull out while waiting for something or just for fun. It's great for a Sonic mobile app
4,"This is a great runner-racer hybrid with over 30 unlockable characters(each with unique stats) and still retains the feel of a console Sonic game. My only issue with it is the ""ad free"" version, which isn't really ad free. It removes the required ads in order to play, but if you don't want to wait 4..."
4,"Sonic Forces Speed Battle is an amazing game, however, it does not save your data through uninstallation. Once I refownloaded the app after deleting it on accident, I was devastated as my characters and stats were gone. 4/5"
4,"I would rather just have the boosters, not tools for attaking other players! please take them off, cause I suck at this game👿👿👿 please take off the attack wepons because I keep losing all of my trophies, I just want the boosters that speed you up"
4,"Good Sonic racing coop game if you want to challenge other people and grind medals. But I'mma giving this game 4 stars because it's quite grindy if you want your favorite character such as Shadow or Blaze like by a instant get away you have to earn them by your wallet. Anyways, It's a cool game with fun coop experience."
4,Great game but it has a lot more potential than it is. Characters don't have a 3d model when you are in the main menu so it's hard to see what they look like when your not playing. really don't have a voice. there is not really a way I can play with my friend's who have downloaded the game so really a lot more content could be added. over all the game is great. A wide span of characters to choose from each unique in their own way. I hope there is a new update so I can change my review. Thx alot.
3,"This game has been pretty fun and I would like to play it more, however I have been having problems with the game constantly crashing and I could only assume that it's because of my high rank. If I can no longer play this game, then I understand, but I do hope that you will eventually fix the crashing problems I have been having so that others don't have to deal with it as well."
3,"Well its a good game but there are some major things that need to be updated, for example 10$ for tails vault take it down to 5$-----7$.Another tip so it dosent wind up like sonic runners, try to balance the items so its more fair, then after that try and make companion pets so it can give us major or minor power's,and as a bonus it'll make great event characters. but overall its still a good game but this is the end of my feedback bye"
3,The thing is I really love this game but some of my friends think that it's unfair all because they can't level up their characters with more than 90 cards and it's not fair to me and my friends. :( If it's not fixed for people then I'm never ever ever playing this game for a while. I don't want to be mean but it's true because it's not fair for people to loose so many trophies and it only makes things worse for others. Edit: I just want it to be fair to other players to loose less trophies.
3,"It's a great game and all, but Sega, I have to point this out. This game is a bit of a pay to win game. There has been an offer on Shadow cards for almost 6 months, and it keeps saying that the ""offer"" ends in a week. Sometimes items hit an opponent, but it does nothing, and character abilities are unbalanced. Slugger Sonic and Blaze, for example. I can win with Blaze and she's only a rare. Slugger Sonic is an event character! Okay, SEGA, so your money beggers. Just stop. It's not worth it."
2,"It was fun but all of the sudden it keeps crashing and forced closing the app. Ive deleted a few things because maybe its the ram who caused this but still, no progress... before that it sometimes bugs a lot and lags even when the internet has a strong connection. Please solve this, i dont want to miss out the event, this is very sad to be exprienced by a user. :("
2,Great game! But strongly dislike the fact that we have 4 treasure chest slots & we can only open one at a time set on a timer?! Some chests have a timer of 8-12 hours! We should be able to unlock multiple chest at a time.
1,Downloaded the game to rekindle my childhood memories. The game firstly did not want to start and kept saying 'retry'. Then after it started it was laggy and kept crashing. May be a fun game in the future.
1,"There are to many adds, the power ups don't work sometimes, example: I hit someone and yet they still keep on going like its nothing or when it does work it still only stuns them for one second pushing them back like 0.1 spaces. And the chests take way to long to open. 1/5 overall a terrible experience I hope Sega actually changes there game so I can change this to a 5/5 for now I'll leave it how it is."
1,"Pay to win and forces to compete against other players (thought this was a single player game). Epic fail, this sort of thing is exactly why mobile will never be a serious gaming platform."
1,This game is ok . But sometimes when I race I am first but it put me in fourth place I was so angry and SEGA it's for free the game but we need to pay now . The game SUCKS I deleted it . This game SUCKS SEGA 😡 and because we need to pay I can't unlock characters. This game sucks
1,"Started out great , but how and why should I lose points cuz of a bad connection ?? It returns you to the main menu and reduces HARD earned points. This game Definitely needs to rethink that part or else I'm deleting it and never recommending the game to anyone !"
1,"Ok, so this game is ok but there is a lot of things i HATE about this game. Like how sometimes when a item hits a person it does nothing to them. Also some of the items and characters are severely unbalanced. I'm looking at blaze😡😡😡 and the vault. It says ""FREE GAME"" but it costs actual money. Ok so Sega is begging for money, screw this game. I'm done :Edit: I deleted this game. Sega this is on you"
1,I enjoyed the races but what happened to story mode!?!? The game was also glitchy and tended not to let me move sonic. Also about story mode... WHAT HAPPENED TO IT!!! Does it even exist? Its all on YouTube but when I just got the game an hour or two ago I couldn't find story mode! It sucked I went into Google and looked up how to play soni forces story mode and there was only useless frick so of course I just deleted the game. One last thing... DONT GET THE GAME! IT SUCKS ASS!
1,"So at first I started to like this game but now it keeps crashing and kicking me out of the entire app.For example today while I was playing on a different device,I was at first place and the finish line was right there,then it kicked me out and when I got back it said I was in last place.Also SEGA,WHY IS THE GAME FREE BUT WE HAVE TO PAY FOR THE THINGS THERE LIKE THE TAILS VAULT,IT COSTS FREAKING 10$. YOU MESSED UP,I NOW SEE YA BEGGIN FOR MONEY.I HATE THIS GAME,THIS IS THE WORST SONIC GAME EVER!"
